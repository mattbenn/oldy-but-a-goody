# Oldy, but a goody: Retreading a candy-wrapper-strewn path
Or, a short foray into data wrangling

I took a crack at cleaning and presenting some basic findings of Cohen and Ng's Candy Hierarchy surveys from the Science Creative Quarterly (links: https://boingboing.net/2017/10/30/the-2017-halloween-candy-hiera.html and https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/). The Candy Hierarchy surveys ran yearly from 2014 to 2017, and the raw data can be acquired for every year but 2014 (for which only aggregate data is available). You can view '2016_cleaned.csv' to get an idea of how the data is formatted.

After cleaning the raw data in Microsoft Excel I imported data into Jupyter Notebook and finished the analysis there. I walk readers through the analysis, conclusion, and possibilities for future analyses in 'Candy Analysis.ipynb'. Despite using somewhat different methods and a slightly truncated dataset, I achieved the same end results as Cohen and Ng (https://boingboing.net/2019/10/30/the-official-2019-candy-hierar.html).
